What if we could start again with our calendar. Would it have 7 days and 12 months?

## 13 Months

Given a lunar cycle of ~29.5 days, it seems to me that we could keep our current 7 days in a week and have a standard four week month. This would mean that the phases of the moon would slowly drift from our month, much like they do now.

28 x 13 = 364 days. This means that we have an extra month that we have to accommodate and name.

## Extra days

With the one or two days left over, these should not be a normal weekday. By doing this, we can ensure that the same day of the year falls on the same day of the week every year.

January the first would start on a Monday, and after thirteen months we would end up on the end of the fourth week of the thirteenth month on a Sunday. The next day or two days (depending on whether it was a leap year) would be days with unique names, rather than any of our current names for days of the week.

## Time

A day has 60x60x24 = 86400 seconds. I wonder if there's a way to simplify time, while keeping the second as the basic unit of time.
