I'm currently trying to move my old blog to Blogger, as this is the only free online service I can find that will let me use my own domain name for my blog (both Wordpress and Drupal Garden will only allow custom domain names as a paid service). In part this post is to help me export my old Drupal blog, by giving me an idea of what the XML file for import should look like.
