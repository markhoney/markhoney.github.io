Well, we made it! Karen and I have just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.

Karen leaves for England tomorrow and won't be back for 2 months - just in time for [Rebecca's](http://rebecca.honeychurch.org/) 1st birthday. In the meantime, I'll be putting a new kitchen in the house here in Porirua and Karen will be celebrating her grandma's 90th and sister's 30th birthdays in good old Blighty.
