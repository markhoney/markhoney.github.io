Gosh, it's been exactly a year since my last post!

I've spent a very fun day at the Pipitea Marae, helping out with the [2016 CodeClub MashUp](https://mashup.codeclub.nz/). Although the team of kids I mentored didn't get to pitch their idea at the end of the day, it was an amazing event - very chaotic and ad-hoc, but a lot of fun all the same.

I'm looking forward to next year's event - maybe the CoderDojo team will even run a workshop or two on the day.
