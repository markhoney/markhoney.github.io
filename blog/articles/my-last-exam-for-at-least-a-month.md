Woo hoo!

I've just passed my Microsoft [070-299](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-299.mspx): Implementing and Administering Security in a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network exam, which is the last exam I'll be taking until after Karen has left for England at the end of July. With this exam, I am now MCSA + Security certified. This complements the other Microsoft, Linux, NetApp, etc exams I have taken in the last few months.

Without further ado, it's time to boast! Here's a full listing of my qualifications:

* DCSE (Dell Certified Systems Expert)

* LPIC-1 (LPI Linux Level 1 Certified)

* LPIC-2 (LPI Linux Level 2 Certified)

* UCP (Ubuntu Certified Professional)

Next up (in August) are my CCNA, CCNP, NCIE and MCSE qualifications. The Cisco stuff is going to be a lot of work as I have no experience of Cisco administration.
