I was [interviewed the other day](http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-334-11mar2015) by Richard Saunders on the Skeptic Zone Podcast about what's been happening with the [NZ Skeptics Society](http://skeptics.nz/) since I became Chair. Moose and moa were mulled over. I was also asked about Shuzi Qi, as the Australian Skeptics had [a good result](http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/if-you-knew-shuzi/) a few years ago dealing with them, and would like to see the NZ Skeptics attempting something similar. [Skeptics in the Pub](http://skepticsinthepub.net.nz/) was mentioned, and we talked about how popular our local pub meetings are. Something else that came up was the new look of the NZ Skeptics, with a new journal, logo and website - but I'll cover that in more detail in a future post.

Yours truly was also interviewed a while ago about the [Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.org.nz/), along with Mark Hanna, on the [Token Skeptic Podcast](http://tokenskeptic.org/2014/09/16/episode-one-hundred-and-eighty-seven-on-the-society-for-science-based-healthcare/).

Of course, if you like the sound of my voice you can always try my own podcast, [Skepticism Today](http://skepticism.today/). Unlike Skeptic Zone or Token Skeptic we're just a monthly podcast, but hopefully what we lack in frequency we make up for in quality!
