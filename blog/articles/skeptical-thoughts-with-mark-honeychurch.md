I filled in yesterday for Siouxsie Wiles yesterday on Graeme Hill's show on Radio Live - Skeptical Thoughts on Graeme's Weekend Variety Wireless show. Last night's episode was titled "[Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch](http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Skeptical-Thoughts-with-Mark-Honeychurch/tabid/506/articleID/94312/Default.aspx)". Yesterday's chat was a good opportunity for me to talk about all things skeptical, and a great opportunity to speak about some of the nonsense currently happening in New Zealand.
