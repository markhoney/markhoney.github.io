This is an advanced warning for anyone driving in and around Wellington, NZ. I have finally (at the ripe old age of 32) passed my driving test, or at least the first of two here in New Zealand, and am now allowed to drive without anyone supervising me.

There is some good news, though. I'm not allowed to drive without supervision between the hours of 10pm and 5am, so if you need to get somewhere please try to travel between these times.
