Today I was perusing a [KML file](http://dl.nin.com/kml/slip_dls.kml) in [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) from the [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.nin.com/). The Nine Inch Nails recently released an album called [The Slip](http://theslip.nin.com/) as a free download, something which I applaud and which a couple of other high profile bands, [Radiohead](http://www.inrainbows.com/) and [Saul Williams](http://www.saulwilliams.com/), have also done recently. While I was in Google Earth, I zoomed into the Isles of Scilly to see if they've been imaged at a decent resolution yet - and unfortunately, the islands are looking as smudged as ever!

I figured that I'd see if google could do anything about this, so I sent them a message through their Google Earth [Help Center](http://earth.google.com/support/bin/request.py?&extra.customer=GEFree&contact_type=data)

[Merryn](http://www.myspace.com/nicebergg) (don't click on the link unless you have to - it's myspace!) has emailed me to let me know that if you zoom in really close on [192.com](http://www.192.com/)'s Street Maps, the map changes to satellite imagery. So, without further ado, here's a link to [my old house](http://www.192.com/maps/?lev=1&px=91528&py=10262.5) on the Isles of Scilly.
