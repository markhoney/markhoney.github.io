[Leigh Hunt](http://porirua.coderdojo.org.nz/about/mentors/#leigh) and I have just run the first [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.org.nz/) session at [Glenview school](http://glenviewschoolporirua.blogspot.co.nz/) in Porirua East, a local [Tokelauan](http://tokelau.org.nz/) school. One of the things we've wanted to do for a while now is to run CoderDojo sessions at schools, and our first session at Glenview was a good experience.

Leigh started the session off with a video about the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/nz) material we use to teach the kids, and then they all launched straight into the [Course 2 challenges](http://studio.code.org/s/course2). Some of the kids also had a go at programming a [Tessel](https://tessel.io/), and managed to read data from temperature and humidity sensors.
