The other day a couple of friendly Jehovah's Witnesses, both of whom I've talked to over the past few years, came to my door to invite me to a conference - and so today I attended the Jehovah's Witness Convention in Te Rauparaha Arena in Wellington. It was great to be able to listen and observe, and I spent the time messaging an ex Jehovah's Witness friend and asking him to fill in some details about what I was seeing. It was great to get an insider's perspective of the event and the kinds of people who become Jehovah's Witnesses.

I'll be popping back tomorrow, and then talking about how it all was [on the radio](https://www.radiolive.co.nz/home/shows/weekend-variety-wireless-with-graeme-hill/skeptical-thoughts.html) tomorrow night.

In other news, I've become a convert to NodeJS, Vue and GraphQL. I'm working on a few projects - both work related and outside of work - where I've been able to use these technologies, and it's great to be working with modern libraries and tools such as Vue's new CLI 3 (which, weirdly, has a great GUI component to it).
