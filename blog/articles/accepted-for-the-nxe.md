I applied for the beta program for Microsoft's [New XBox Experience](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/nxe/) and received an acceptance email today. Hopefully the new dashboard will be available for download tomorrow, so I'll have that and the new version of [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)/[Mythbuntu](http://www.mythbuntu.org/) to download. Below is my acceptance email, as my way of gloating!
