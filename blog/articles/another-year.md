Another year, another blog post.

Today started with me staying up until 2am writing [the NZ Skeptics' submission](http://skeptics.nz/submissions/pharmacy-council-ethics-2) to the [Pharmacy Council's Consultation](http://www.pharmacycouncil.org.nz/Portals/12/Documents/consultations/Code%20of%20Ethics%20Review%20consultation%20document%202017-%20final%20post%20Council%2017%20July%202017.pdf?ver=2017-07-17-161011-343) on their proposed new Code of Ethics (spoiler alert: I don't think the code is strong enough to protect consumers), continued when I flew to Christchurch for the day to install some new storage (between this and another job this week, I've installed over half a Petabyte of storage this week!), was followed up by a quiz at Plimmerton School (where the quizmasters got at least one answer wrong - they said that the largest named number is a [googolplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex), but we all know it's [Graham's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number), or maybe [TREE(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem#TREE.283.29)) and finished with me coding some Websockets stuff for location tracking, and trying to get my head around [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Wow, that was a long sentence!

I now have a project deadline of Monday for a website frontend (which needs to integrate with a [Koa](http://koajs.com/) backend I've put together), [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.nz/) this afternoon, where we're going to continue building an [AR sandbox](http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/) with the kids and then I'll probably need to head back to Christchurch early next week to finish off the storage job I was there for.
