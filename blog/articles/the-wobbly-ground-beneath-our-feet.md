Here in NZ we have earthquakes fairly regularly. In fact, we've just had one - the house shook a little and made a bit of noise, but nothing major. A great place to keep an eye on these quakes (and to make sure that what you just experienced was an earthquake and not something more sinister, such as the unlikely event of a terrorist attack) is [GeoNet](http://www.geonet.org.nz/). Below is an image of the GeoNet recordings from all New Zealand drums from just after the earthquake:

The second image is of the earthquake as recorded by our local (Karori, Wellington) seismograph drum:
