He is a nuclear physicist, whose PhD focussed on nuclear decay. He worked in electronics for the military for nearly 40 years, and argues that the earth is only 6,000 years old.

## Martin Harris is Supreme Winner at the Pharmacy Awards

[http://www.pharmacyawards.co.nz/winners-2015/](http://www.pharmacyawards.co.nz/winners-2015/)

Hosted by Pharmacy Guild of NZ and Pharmacy Today

Is previous winner of Best Complementary Healthcare Campaign in 2012:

To win this award you need to have come up with a complementary health promotion or ongoing programme that has contributed to improved retail result, in areas such as, vitamins, supplements, sports nutrition or homeopathy.

Mr Harris last year defended selling homeopathy (from Pharmacy Today):

Auckland pharmacist Martin Harris says there is good evidence for homeopathy in the field of quantum physics.

"There's no placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised controlled trials using one remedy and one result because homeopathy doesn't work that way, it works on energy," Mr Harris says.

Mr Harris, who specialises in nutrition medicine, admits he is no expert when it comes to homeopathy.

Pharmacy Council Says:

YOU MUST:

Only purchase, supply or promote any medicine, complementary therapy, herbal remedy or other healthcare product where there is no reason to doubt its quality or safety and when there is credible evidence of efficacy.

There is no evidence that homeopathy is a treatment for any condition. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Aus confirmed this:

[https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-topics/complementary-medicines/homeopathy-review](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-topics/complementary-medicines/homeopathy-review)

NHMRC concludes that there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective. Homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious. People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.

Australian pharmacist Grant McGill threw away all his homeopathic remedies, saying:

I've never promoted or recommended these products but I've accepted them passively and I felt a bit hypocritical having them on the shelves.

I operate a bit differently to corporate chains and believe a pharmacy should be professional rather than a place selling a lot of cosmetics.

If someone comes in with sleep problems, I will look at what is known to help and address things like sleep hygiene issues, rather than recommending flower essences.

## Waisake Naholo's miracle healing

Waisake Naholo has a cracked fibula - the smaller of the lower leg bones (alongside the tibia).

All Blacks coach Steven Hansen said:

    "he was weight-bearing on it and pretty good", "there's a really fine crack in it. There's no displacement (of the bone)"

Wikipedia says "The fibula does not carry any significant load", and that it's more for stability for the ankle joint and attachment points for muscles.

His uncle Isei Naiova applied traditional leaves known as kawakawarau on Naholo's leg for two sets of four days. Apparently he lost his limp and was able to do light exercises.

The miracle cure was attributed to "a gift from God", the Fiji Times reported.

    "This healing has been performed by our forefathers and has been passed down from generation to generation. It is a gift from God"

    "When I first touched his leg I could feel his bones were damaged,"

Hansen said

    "So who are we to poo-hoo alternative medicine? The Chinese have been doing it for years."

    "If it works, I'm a believer"

## Resene Promotes Colour Therapy

[http://www.resene.co.nz/homeown/use_colr/colour_therapy.htm](http://www.resene.co.nz/homeown/use_colr/colour_therapy.htm)

Most of the serious claims have already been removed, after I talked to them on the phone, but they still talk about crystal energy and other nonsense concepts.

## Advertising Standards Authority Complaints

[http://asa.sbh.nz/?sbh](http://asa.sbh.nz/?sbh)

A new website shows stats for ASA complaints. There are lots of companies making unsupported claims, such as Life Energy Designs - who tell us that the earth poisons us with Electromagnetic Waves ("Geopathic Stress") and that we should purchase their devices to keep us protected.
