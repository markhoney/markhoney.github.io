This support involved both completing work requests and fault fixing. Work requests included maintaining the Active Directory environment, providing network shares, building PCs and installing software. Fault fixing covered the whole range of the bank's IT hardware and software, with the hardware mainly consisting of Compaq/HP and Dell servers, PCs and Laptops, and software running to hundreds of packages. Issues dealt with ranged from dial-up and broadband problems, through OS and application faults to Exchange and Active Directory problems.</p> <p>After several months in the role, I became Technical Lead of gen-i's ANZ Server Support team, looking after all ANZ and NBNZ production servers. This involved a mixture of projects and day-to-day administration of branch and corporate servers, including backups, hardware and software problems and routine maintenance. Faults were fixed within SLA and, in alignment with ITIL best practice, problem records were created and root causes diagnosed and repaired. Incidents ranged from the relatively simple, such as SCSI drive and other hardware failures, to the complex, such as troubleshooting NDMP backup problems between OmniBack and snapshots on EMC Celerra NAS servers.</p> <p>As well as supporting the environment, I supported the other server engineers on the contract – helping with technical issues, running weekly meetings and distributing work when required.

I also installed a logfile analysis package to give staff access to metrics on website usage by the public.</p> <p><strong>Proxy Install.</strong> I installed a Mandrake-based Squid proxy server, and configured it to allow different levels of filtering for staff and public. This also allowed measurement of bandwidth use of our fibre link.</p> <p><strong>Helpdesk System.</strong> I installed a FreeBSD server with a web-based helpdesk application and used this to run the helpdesk, tracking all calls and delegating them to staff members' helpdesk accounts.</p> <p><strong>Library Catalog.</strong> I installed and configured a Java-based application to provide an online access Library Catalogue, and edited the source code to integrate the visual style of the website with the existing corporate style.</p> <p><strong>Public Directory.</strong> Similarly to the Library Catalogue project, I installed an XML-based public resources database with web front-end and edited the code to integrate it visually with the rest of LBWF's web applications.</p> <h3 id="installations-engineer"><a href="#installations-engineer" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Installations Engineer</h3> <p><a href="https://www.ubs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UBS Warburg<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <em>London, England</em> (2000-11 - 2001-05)</p> <p>As a member of the trading floor desktop installations team, my primary role was the building, installation and support of Windows NT4 and Windows 2000 Workstations and Laptops. We supported several hundred traders and support staff, who would typically have several workstations each, including a primary NT4 workstation with quad-head display and dedicated Bloomberg, NeXT and Sun machines, along with 7 or 8 flat screen displays. I also installed and configured Weytech keyboards which allowed control of up to 6 workstations, as well as enabling workstation sharing, control of multiple screen switches, keyboard emulation (PC, Sun, Bloomberg, etc.) and key-press macro recording. The position also involved network troubleshooting, email support (Outlook and CCMail) and administration of NT user and resource domains.</p> <h3 id="network-analyst-2"><a href="#network-analyst-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Network Analyst</h3> <p><a href="https://www.stgeorge.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. George Bank<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <em>Sydney, Australia</em> (1999-04 - 1999-11)</p> <p>My role at St. George was providing third level support for the Client Server Technical Systems (CSTS) Department. As such I was part of a team delivering support to the Core Network File Servers and associated software. This support was both for the Kogarah Head Office (2500 users), and a distributed branch infrastructure across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia (8000 users).</p> <p>On top of this support I administered the ISYS helpdesk system, a database of helpdesk calls. Problems relevant to the team were either resolved by myself or delegated by me to another member of the team. This provided work on a wide range of problems throughout the bank. Frequent problems included IP conflict troubleshooting, restoring of data from ARCserve and ADSM backups and fixing printer problems.</p> <h4 id="projects-7"><a href="#projects-7" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Projects</h4> <p><strong>Automation.</strong> Having found that several batch files and other scripts were being run to copy files cross the network, I created a program in Delphi to allow automated file distribution over the LAN. The program allowed the user to create multiple jobs and specify which files to copy, where from/to and when/how often.</p> <p><strong>Ebank Rollout.</strong> St. George’s new Electronic Banking system (EBank) occasionally had IP-related problems with client networks, which I was tasked with troubleshooting. I designed and built a test network to help pinpoint potential problems, and then helped to write a questionnaire designed to discover which clients would most likely encounter problems. After talking to clients’ IT personnel on the phone to build a clear picture of how their network was set up, I would advise the installation team on any special installation requirements. If an installation still had problems, I would personally visit the client site and troubleshoot their network in order to resolve the conflict.</p> <h3 id="systems-administrator"><a href="#systems-administrator" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Systems Administrator</h3> <p><a href="https://transportnsw.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rail Services Australia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <em>Sydney, Australia</em> (1999-01 - 1999-04)</p> <p>During my first contract with RSA I was responsible for the migration from WFW 3.11 to NT 4.0 at a range of sites in and around Sydney.
